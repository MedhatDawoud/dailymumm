There are an online staging version for Dailymumm (check it out from [here](https://goo.gl/JBw542))

### what technologies that i used ? ###

* MongoDB - as a database, light and convenient for application purpose.
* NodeJs - as server side application representing APIs.
* Express - used as a framework on node to enable creating routes and APIs in an easy way.
* SocketIO - a node package for real-time send/receive data.
* AngularJS - as a frontend framework.
* Angular UI Router - to facilitate routing and for its features.
* Karma - as a test runner.
* Jasmine - as a unit testing framework, easy and efficient.
* HTML5/CSS3 - for sure they are used for views UI creating and styling.
* Twitter Bootstrap - as UI framework.
* SASS - as CSS preprocessor.
* Over all its MEAN stack.

### What is the pattern and the archeticture that i used ? ###

* I've applied the IIFE pattern in all my files to isolate contexts.
* I've depend on separation of dependencies so each page has a folder that hold its controller file and view file as well.
* I've separate app module initialization and app routes in 2 files.
* About the UI, Iâ€™ve did what I see simple and good in the same time for this application, video background.
* I've created a custom component for each segment in code that might be reusable later.
* I've applied components of angular 1.5 instead of directives old style.

### Setup prerequists ###

* you have to install NodeJS as it's the service and also to use its package manager npm.
* you have to install sass. ([way to install sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)).
* you should install compass to facilitate the compilation of sass to css ([Here you go](http://compass-style.org/install/)).
* you have to install MongoDb locally.

### How to run the application ###

* clone or download files in some place.
* open CMD or Terminal in the root folder you just cloned.
* write this command `npm install` to install dependencies.
* then write this command `compass compile` to compile sass files into css files.
* start mongodb, if you add it to your variables on windows create a folder name it data in c drive and write this command `mongod --dbpath c:/data`.
* then write `npm test` to run tests and make sure that they are all green.
* Finally write `npm start` to start application and run it in the browser at `http://localhost` as i've used port 80.
* Cool !!

### What's next ? ###

* planing to convert it from angularjs to angular 2.
* convert every thing to TypeScript and ES7.
* using webpack to bundle every thing.
* add more features ...
